### 1) collections.Counter() 
>A counter is a container that stores elements as dictionary keys, and their counts are stored 
as dictionary values.
```
>>> from collections import Counter
>>> 
>>> myList = [1,1,2,3,4,5,3,2,3,4,2,1,2,3]
>>> print Counter(myList)
Counter({2: 4, 3: 4, 1: 3, 4: 2, 5: 1})
>>>
>>> print Counter(myList).items()
[(1, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 2), (5, 1)]
>>> 
>>> print Counter(myList).keys()
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
>>> 
>>> print Counter(myList).values()
[3, 4, 4, 2, 1] 
```

### 2) collections.namedtuple()
>Basically, namedtuples are easy to create, lightweight object types. 
They turn tuples into convenient containers for simple tasks. 
With namedtuples, you donâ€™t have to use integer indices for accessing members of a tuple.

```
# Code 01

>>> from collections import namedtuple
>>> Point = namedtuple('Point','x,y')
>>> pt1 = Point(1,2)
>>> pt2 = Point(3,4)
>>> dot_product = ( pt1.x * pt2.x ) +( pt1.y * pt2.y )
>>> print dot_product
11


# Code 02

>>> from collections import namedtuple
>>> Car = namedtuple('Car','Price Mileage Colour Class')
>>> xyz = Car(Price = 100000, Mileage = 30, Colour = 'Cyan', Class = 'Y')
>>> print xyz
Car(Price=100000, Mileage=30, Colour='Cyan', Class='Y')
>>> print xyz.Class
Y
